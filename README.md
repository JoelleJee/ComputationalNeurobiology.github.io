# How to add yourself as a member

* fork this repository
* open in RStudio
* copy a table block in members.md
* edit the table and add photo (to images folder or absolute http link)
** tables are finicky for formatting - line up the pipes
* click on Preview to generate a html file from md file
* commit to your local git repo, push to your github repo then do a pull request in github
